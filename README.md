# SwiftUiKitBasics

## IAmRich/IAmPoor

This was my first app made with Swift and it takes inspiration from the famous IAmRich app. The original app was released in 2008 and cost $999.99 dollars before it was removed by Apple. I learned how to switch the data displayed in a UILabel, how to use a UIButton, and got familiar with Xcode in general.
